This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The Bug.java file contains code that produces this exception, while Solution.java shows how to fix it.  The exception occurs when attempting to access an array element outside the valid index range.  This is a frequent issue in programming, particularly when working with loops and arrays. The solution emphasizes robust array index checking to prevent this type of runtime error.
